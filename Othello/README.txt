This Python script brings the classic game of Othello to life on your computer screen, complete with a colorful and interactive interface. You have two ways to play: against a friend or against the computer.

In "Two Player Mode," you and a friend can take turns making moves on the Othello board, trying to outmaneuver each other to capture the most discs and dominate the board.

If you're feeling more like a solo player, "Player vs AI Mode" pits you against a computer opponent. But don't worry, you can choose the difficulty level to match your skills. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned Othello player, there's a challenge waiting for you.

The game interface is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy to see the current state of the game at a glance. Legal moves are highlighted, and it's clear whose turn it is.

As you play, the game keeps track of the number of discs for each player and displays them on the screen. When the game ends, whether by filling the board or when neither player can make a legal move, the winner is declared based on who has the most discs.

So, if you're ready for some strategic fun, just run the script and start playing Othello right away. It's a timeless game that's easy to learn but offers endless opportunities for strategy and excitement. Enjoy the challenge!
